# A list of some useful SLURM commands when on the cluster:

1: SLURM account
type >> sacct

Description: 
Gives a listing of the jobs you have submitted to the scheduler, or are running, as
of 12 AM (midnight) of the current day. Displays the JobID, stats (PENDING, RUNNING
or COMPLETED), and some other details.

2: Your SLURM queue
type >> squeue -u #USERNAME

Description:
Similar to sacct, but will give current runtime and additional details of each of your
jobs on the cluster. If you do not pass the -u (username) optional command, this will
give a list of ALL jobs running or pending on the cluster!

3: SLURM cancel
type >> scancel #JOBID
type >> scancel -u #USERNAME

Description:
Used to cancel a job before it completes, the first cancels a specific job if you have
the JobID, the second (with the optional -u command) cancels all jobs you have running
on the cluster.

4: Get full job details
type >> scontrol show job #JOBID

Description:
Gives a complete listing of all SLURM metadata associated with a pending or running job
Note that you can use this command on any job, not just your own!

# For programming environments

5: Get currently loaded modules
type >> module list

Description:
This lists all modules currently loaded in your working environment on the cluster. This 
is very useful when compiling or debugging programs, as having different modules (libraries)
loaded between different usages of the same application will cause unexpected behavior.

6: Search for modules
type >> module avail #SEARCHTERM

Description:
Gives a list of all available modules that match a given search term, such as module avail python.
Note that some moduels have multiple versions, in the format NAME/VERSION.NUMBER.

7: Load a module
type >> module load #MODULENAME

Description:
Loads a module by name. For modules with multiple versions, providing just the name of the module
will load whatever is the default version on the cluster (sometimes not the most recent!)
